I am a PhD student at <a href="https://www.laas.fr/public/">LAAS-CNRS</a> in <a href="https://gepettoweb.laas.fr/">Gepetto team</a> since 2018 working on 
various aspects related to legged robot state estimation.

Main main research topic is at the interface between factor graph state estimation and legged robotics. I proposed new formulations
for measurement models of proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors and implemented solutions on quadruped and humanoid robots. The goal
of this project is to fuse all sensor modalities in a single tightly coupled estimator to provide a globally consistent robot pose estimation
that can be used for both estimation and planning.
I work under the supervision of both <a href="https://gepettoweb.laas.fr/index.php/Members/NicolasMansard">Nicolas Mansard</a> and 
<a href="http://www.joansola.eu/">Joan Sol√†</a>.

I received an aerospace engineering degree from <a href="https://www.isae-supaero.fr/en/">ISAE Supaero</a> with speciality in data science, robotics and operational research. I completed my Master Thesis as part of the <a href="http://osl.eps.hw.ac.uk/index.php">Ocean System Laboratory</a>, working on visual servoing and force control
under the supervision of <a href="https://www.edinburgh-robotics.org/academics/yvan-petillot">Yvan Petillot</a> at Heriot Watt University, Edinburgh, UK.
