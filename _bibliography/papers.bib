  title={Absolute humanoid localization and mapping based on IMU Lie group and fiducial markers},

  abstract={Current locomotion algorithms in structured (indoor) 3D environments require an accurate localization. The
several and diverse sensors typically embedded on legged robots
(IMU, coders, vision and/or LIDARS) should make it possible
if properly fused. Yet this is a difficult task due to the heterogeneity of these sensors and the real-time requirement of the
control. While previous works were using staggered approaches
(odometry at high frequency, sparsely corrected from vision and
LIDAR localization), the recent progress in optimal estimation,
in particular in visual-inertial localization, is paving the way to
a holistic fusion. This paper is a contribution in this direction.
We propose to quantify how a visual-inertial navigation system
can accurately localize a humanoid robot in a 3D indoor
environment tagged with fiducial markers. We introduce a theoretical contribution strengthening the formulation of Forsterâ€™s
IMU pre-integration, a practical contribution to avoid possible
ambiguity raised by pose estimation of fiducial markers, and an
experimental contribution on a humanoid dataset with ground
truth. Our system is able to localize the robot with less than 2 cm
errors once the environment is properly mapped. This would
naturally extend to additional measurements corresponding to
leg odometry (kinematic factors) thanks to the genericity of the
proposed pre-integration algebra.},

  title={Contact Forces Preintegration for Estimation in Legged Robotics using Factor Graphs},
  author={Fourmy, M{\'e}d{\'e}ric and Flayols, Thomas and L{\'e}ziart, Pierre-Alexandre and Mansard, Nicolas and Sol{\`a}, Joan},
  abstract={State estimation, in particular estimation of the
base position, orientation and velocity, plays a big role in
the efficiency of legged robot stabilization. The estimation of
the base state is particularly important because of its strong
correlation with the underactuated dynamics, i.e. the evolution
of center of mass and angular momentum. Yet this estimation
is typically done in two phases, first estimating the base state,
then reconstructing the center of mass from the robot model.
The underactuated dynamics is indeed not properly observed,
and any bias in the model would not be corrected from
the sensors. While it has already been observed that force
measurements make such a bias observable, these are often
only used for a binary estimation of the contact state. In this
paper, we propose to simultaneously estimate the base and the
underactuation state by using all measurements simultaneously.
To this end, we propose several contributions to implement a
complete state estimator using factor graphs. Contact forces
altering the underactuated dynamics are pre-integrated using
a novel adaptation of the IMU pre-integration method, which
constitutes the principal contribution. IMU pre-integration is
also used to measure the positional motion of the base. Encoder
measurements are then participating to the estimation in two
ways: by providing leg odometry displacements, contributing to
the observability of IMU biases; and by relating the positional
and centroidal states, thus connecting the whole graph and
producing a tightly-coupled whole-body estimator. The validity
of the approach is demonstrated on real data captured by the
Solo12 quadruped robot},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
